# TensorFlow Exercises

TensorFlow is arugably the most popular deep learning library as of 2017.

This is designed to help those who want to familiarize themselves with TensorFlow functions. Particulary, I focus on comparing TensorFlow functions with the equivalent functions in NumPy, the de facto standard numerical computation library. I hope this will help you get comfortable with TensorFlow quickly.

The basic outline will be as follows, though this is not 100% fixed.

* Constants, Sequences, and Random Values (DONE)
* Graphs 
* Variables 
* Reading Data 
* Tensor Transformations 
* Math Part 1 
* Math Part 2 
* Math Part 3 
* Strings 
* Control Flow 
* Images 
* Sparse Tensors 
* Neural Network Part 1 
* Neural Network Part 2 
* Neural Network Part 3 
* Seq2Seq 
* Audio_Processing 

Enjoy!
